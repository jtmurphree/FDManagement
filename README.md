# FDManagment API

<p>This is the webapi for an angular Fire Department Management system. The Angular front end for FireDeptManagment is in a seperate repository. In the future it is planned that both systems will be in the 
same repository for ease of cloning and running the system. The database for the system is a SQL Server database and there are no plans to make it available. However, the SQL files will be attached to make it 
easier to create the database in your local environment or event to create it in  something other than SQL Server.</p>

# Current State
<p>FireDeptManagement is still in the early stages of management. This API, while functional, in no way ressembles the final state of the application. The below list states future work that is planned on this application. This list
is not all inclusive and will be updated as further needed work is identified.</p>

# To Do
<ul>
	<li>Implement authenticatoin and security</li>
	<li>Implement hashing of passwords before storing in DB</li>
</ul>
